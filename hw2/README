Instructions:
run `make clean` to removed the executable files from the directior.
run `make U=test1` to build the executable file.
run `mtip -f test1.lnx` and `~d` on tutor-vserver VM to download the program onto tutor.
run `go 100100` on tutor to run the program.

Typescript file:
austin_guiney_hw_typescript.script.

Program files:
i) Shared between user and kernel:

   tty_public.h: device numbers
   tsyscall.h: syscall numbers (see a sample system call numbers in Linux/i386 system calls)

ii) Kernel files:

   ioconf.h, tty.h: i/o headers used only by kernel
   tsystm.h: syscall dispatch, kernel function prototypes (a copy is posted)
   startup0.s: this file is provided.  Sets up stack, calls into startup1.c
   startup.c: this file is provided, but you need to modify it to call your kernel initialization routine
                   instead of main.
   tunix.c:  has kernel init routine. It needs to call ioinit, call set_trap_gate(0x80,&syscall), and  
                 possibly other inits. tunix.c also has the code for syscallc and sys call exit. The
                 code for set_trap_gate has been provide in libc/cpu.c and built into the libc library


   syscallc: first write it with a big switch statement over the various different syscalls.  If you have time,
                  upgrade it to use a sysent dispatch table.

   sysentry.s:  Trap handler's assembler envelope routine syscall for the trap resulting from a
                  system call--needs to push eax, ebx, ecx, edx on stack, where they can be accessed from C,
                  call syscallc, then pops, iret. Use $pclibsrc/irq4.s as an example and modify it to fit your
                  needs.

   io.c: rename "read" to "sysread", etc. to avoid linking problems, since "read" is a now user-level call.

   ioconf.c, ioconf.h:  from hw1. 

   tty.c, tty.h, tty_public.h:  tty driver from hw1, unchanged

iii) User-level files:

   tunistd.h: prototypes for user mode system calls (like UNIX /usr/include/unistd.h)
   test1.c:  has main().  Easily extended to multiple user files, or user assembler sources, as long as they
            follow the syscall rules and have a main entry point.  First example is
	                        main() { write(TTY1,"hi!\n",4);}.  
             Work back to testio.c from hw1.
   ulib.s:  library set-ups for syscalls: read, write, exit. Provided for write, you add read and exit.
   crt0.s:  user-level "C startup module" sets up stack, calls main, does exit syscall.  Entry point ustart. 
              

iv) hw1 solution files not directly used in hw2:  
   io_public.h:  like tunistd.h above, but also lists ioinit(), and not exit().
   testio.c:  remove ioinit() call here to turn into proper user program.(and note that the kprintf's are
      only for debugging)
